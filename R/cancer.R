#' @title Microarray data set for breast cancer
#'
#' @description This gene expression data set is freely available, coming from 
#' the Hess \emph{et al}'s paper. It concerns one hundred thirty-three patients 
#' with stage I--III breast cancer.  Patients were treated with chemotherapy 
#' prior to surgery. Patient response to the treatment can be classified as 
#' either a pathologic complete response (pCR) or residual disease (not-pCR). 
#' Hess \emph{et al} developed and tested a reliable multigene predictor for 
#' treatment response on this data set, composed by a set of 26 genes having a 
#' high predictive value.
#' @format Two objects \code{expr} (a 26 by 133 matrix with expression levels)
#' and \code{conditions} a vector of conditions for the 26 patients.
